## Presentation
Building on the success of the [5.1-6" version](https://github.com/WE-are-FPV/JeNo-5.1) and [3-3.5" version](https://github.com/WE-are-FPV/JeNo-3-3.5) versions, the **JeNo lineup** expands with this new variation in **7"**. We stay true to the JeNo spirit, offering a **versatile frame** that is perfect for **Long Range, cinematic**, and even **Freestyle** use, thanks to its strength and flight performance.

Given the limited options in the **Open Source** community for 7", especially for DJI O3 setups, we wanted to provide the community with a solid new option that caters to various needs while remaining true to the **"JeNo philosophy"** :

* **Clean Black Box** for easy tuning
* **Modularity**, with **8mm arms** (or 6mm with reinforcements) and a wide range of camera plates:
- Classic at 25°
- High tilt at 40°
- Cinematic with clean FOV ("Wide") / 25° tilt (hard or soft)
- Cinematic with clean FOV ("Wide") / 40° tilt
* Frame and spacers invisible in the video feed with all cameras
* **100% clear FOV** with DJI O3 setups with cinematic camera plates (no frame or propellers visible)
* **Wide X** geometry for better flight feel
* Comfortable bus for lipos up to over 6S / 3000mAh (+140mm available)

Finally, as this frame was designed by members of the [WE are FPV](https://www.wearefpv.fr/) **community**, a **"WaF edition"** is available (the logo is engraved on the bottom plate). Join us on the WAF forum in [the official JeNo 7" thread](https://forum.wearefpv.fr/topic/22687-jeno-7/) to discuss it further.
